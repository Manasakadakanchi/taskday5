        <li>python</li>
        <p>Python is a case-sensitive language, which means that uppercase and lowercase letters are treated differently. For example, 'name' and 'Name' are two different variables in Python.

            In Python, comments can be added using the '#' symbol. Any text written after the '#' symbol is considered a comment and is ignored by the interpreter. This trick is useful for adding notes to the code or temporarily disabling a code block. It also helps in understanding the code better by some other developers.
            
            'If', 'otherwise', 'for', 'while', 'try', 'except', and 'finally' are a few reserved keywords in Python that cannot be used as variable names. These terms are used in the language for particular reasons and have fixed meanings. If you use these keywords, your code may include errors, or the interpreter may reject them as potential new Variables.
            
            History of Python
            Python was created by Guido van Rossum. In the late 1980s, Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, began working on Python while at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. He wanted to create a successor to the ABC programming language that would be easy to read and efficient.
            
            In February 1991, the first public version of Python, version 0.9.0, was released. This marked the official birth of Python as an open-source project. The language was named after the British comedy series "Monty Python's Flying Circus".
            
            Python development has gone through several stages. In January 1994, Python 1.0 was released as a usable and stable programming language. This version included many of the features that are still present in Python today.
            
            From the 1990s to the 2000s, Python gained popularity for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. In October 2000, Python 2.0 was released. Python 2.0 introduced list comprehensions, garbage collection, and support for Unicode.
            
            In December 2008, Python 3.0 was released. Python 3.0 introduced several backward-incompatible changes to improve code readability and maintainability.
            
            Throughout 2010s, Python's popularity increased, particularly in fields like data science, machine learning, and web development. Its rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks made it a favourite among developers.
            
            The Python Software Foundation (PSF) was established in 2001 to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language and its community</p>
        <li>java</li>
        <p>The history of Java is indeed fascinating. Originally designed for interactive television, Java's journey began with the Green Team, a group within Sun Microsystems led by James Gosling. Their goal was to create a programming language for digital devices like set-top boxes and televisions. However, Java's capabilities surpassed the needs of the digital cable television industry at the time. Instead, it found its niche in internet programming, offering a solution that was ahead of its time.

            Java's principles, including simplicity, robustness, portability, platform independence, security, high performance, multithreading, architecture neutrality, object orientation, interpretation, and dynamism, laid the foundation for its development. These principles ensured that Java was not only versatile but also adaptable to a wide range of applications.
            
            James Gosling, often referred to as the father of Java, spearheaded the project in the early 1990s. Alongside his team, known as the Green Team, Gosling worked to refine and develop Java into the language we know today. Their efforts culminated in the release of Java in 1995. Netscape later incorporated Java technology into its browser, further propelling its popularity and solidifying its position as a key player in the world of programming languages. From its humble beginnings in digital television to its widespread use on the internet and beyond, Java has continued to evolve, remaining true to its core principles while adapting to the changing needs of the technological landscape.

            Currently, Java is used in internet programming, mobile devices, games, e-business solutions, etc. Following are given significant points that describe the history of Java.</p>
